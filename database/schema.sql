CSS was made in an era where documents were the height of the web. It doesn\'t fit easily into component-based systems, making styling one of the pain points of building React applications.                              What if we took the best of JavaScript and the best of CSS, and combined them together to create the ultimate solution? Glen Maddern (CSS Modules co-creator) and I sat down and starting thinking about styling in this new paradigm. Let\'s talk about what we thought about and why we arrived where we did \xe2\x80\x93 \xf0\x9f\x92\x85 styled-components.                             |                               React Native mobile just got easier.

It not only allows us to use technologies we know already, like React, to provide first-class native experience to our users, but also to support many platforms, like Android and iOS at once, from within the same codebase.

Next it shows how to create a couple 3D meshes and how put together a small world using them. |                               When you start out on React Native project, there is a certain sense of awe as the package manager delivers the first bundle to the simulator.

So you check out the React Native Docs and are quickly greeted by IOSTabBar, Navigation, and NavigationExperimental modules.
